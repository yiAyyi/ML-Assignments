## Sample Assignment
To give you a taste of what to expect, here is a brief overview of one of the assignments:

### Assignment 1: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
In this assignment, you will build a CNN model using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. You will preprocess the images, define the CNN architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance on a test set. By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in working with CNNs for image classification tasks.
